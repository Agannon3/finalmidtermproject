<!-- My explanation -->

<h1> Why I am interested in Heart Disease </h1>
<p class="paragraph">
    I started learning more about heart disease this year after being <br>
    diagnosed with incomplete right bundle branch block. <br>
    I remember the nurse telling me "your ecg isn't entirely normal" <br>
    and this big wave of uncertainty and depression kicked in. <br>
    This combined with COVID isolation made the next three months <br>
    of going to the cardiologist and doing tests very difficult. <br>
    Thankfully there were no problems! <br>

</p>

<h1> Sources I used </h1>
<p class="paragraph">
    I got most of my information from the American Heart Association and The Mayo Clinic <br>
Just to warn you, The AHA has done some sketchy publication and health advisory deals <br>
with brands that produce poor quality foods, drinks, and snacks. <br>
Their medical information is accurate but we should be skeptical <br>
    of supposed "Heart Healthy" labels on items. <br>
